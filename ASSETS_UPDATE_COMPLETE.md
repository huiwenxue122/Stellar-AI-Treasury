# ✅ Asset Configuration Update - Complete

## 🎯 What Was Done

Successfully updated all asset configurations to be **honest and transparent** about which assets are real vs demo placeholders.

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. ✅ BENJI (Real Tokenized Fund)
**Status**: Real asset - Franklin Templeton tokenized money market fund

**Updated**:
```yaml
benji:
  code: BENJI
  issuer: "FRANKLIN_TEMPLETON_ISSUER_TBD"  # To be verified
  fund_name: "Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund"
  backed_by: "US Treasury securities"
  note: "Real tokenized fund - requires KYC/AML compliance"
```

**Dashboard**: Updated from "BOND" to "BENJI"
- ✅ Asset selection: "BENJI" instead of "BOND"
- ✅ Section title: "Tokenized Funds & Real Estate"
- ✅ Recommendations: "BTC, ETH, USDC, BENJI"

---

### 2. 🎨 GOLD (Demo Placeholder)
**Status**: Demo asset for concept demonstration

**Updated**:
```yaml
gold:
  code: GOLD
  issuer: "DEMO_GOLD_ISSUER"  # Clearly marked as demo
  note: "Placeholder - recommend using PAXG or XAUT for real gold exposure"
```

**Why**: Generic gold token doesn't exist on Stellar. Real gold tokens (PAXG, XAUT) are on Ethereum.

---

### 3. 🏆 PAXG (Real, but on Ethereum)
**Status**: Real asset, but not on Stellar blockchain

**Updated**:
```yaml
paxg:
  code: PAXG
  issuer: "NOT_ON_STELLAR"  # Honest labeling
  blockchain: "Ethereum"
  coingecko_id: "pax-gold"
  note: "PAX Gold exists on Ethereum, not Stellar. Price data via CoinGecko API."
```

**Why**: PAXG is a real Paxos gold-backed token, but it's an Ethereum ERC-20 token, not Stellar native.

---

### 4. 🏆 XAUT (Real, but on Ethereum)
**Status**: Real asset, but not on Stellar blockchain

**Updated**:
```yaml
xaut:
  code: XAUT
  issuer: "NOT_ON_STELLAR"  # Honest labeling
  blockchain: "Ethereum"
  coingecko_id: "tether-gold"
  note: "Tether Gold exists on Ethereum/Tron, not Stellar. Price data via CoinGecko API."
```

**Why**: XAUT is a real Tether gold-backed token (1 oz per token), but it's on Ethereum/Tron, not Stellar.

---

### 5. 🏢 REIT (Demo Placeholder)
**Status**: Demo asset for concept demonstration

**Updated**:
```yaml
reit:
  code: REIT
  issuer: "DEMO_REIT_ISSUER"  # Clearly marked as demo
  note: "Placeholder - in production, integrate with actual tokenized real estate on Stellar"
```

**Why**: Real tokenized real estate on Stellar doesn't exist yet. This demonstrates the capability.
