# 🎨 Dashboard Display Fix - Real-time Capital Update

## 🐛 Issue

User pointed out: "Dashboard应该相应的更新，不然我一点进来就是1M 美金对应的XLM"

**Problem**: Even after selecting $1K, the "Initial Asset" section still showed the default $1M (3,225,806 XLM) until user clicked "Confirm".

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

### Before Fix:

1. **Dashboard initialization**: `xlm_balance = $1M / 0.31` (hardcoded default)
2. **User selects $1K**: `initial_capital_usd = 1000` stored in session_state
3. **"Initial Asset" displays**: Still shows 3,225,806 XLM (old value)
4. **Only after "Confirm"**: `xlm_balance` gets updated to 3,226 XLM

### Why This Happened:

The `number_input` for capital_usd updated `initial_capital_usd`, but **didn't update** `xlm_balance` until the "Confirm" button was clicked.

So the "Initial Asset" section (which displays `xlm_balance`) showed stale data.

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Change 1: Real-time Update of `xlm_balance`

**File**: `app/dashboard.py`, Lines 354-363

```python
# After number_input for capital_usd
st.session_state.initial_capital_usd = capital_usd

# Real-time conversion (using FIXED price $0.31)
FIXED_XLM_PRICE = 0.31
xlm_amount = capital_usd / FIXED_XLM_PRICE

# 💰 IMPORTANT: Also update xlm_balance immediately for display purposes
# This ensures the "Initial Asset" and "Configuration Summary" sections show the correct amount
st.session_state.xlm_balance = xlm_amount  # ✅ Update immediately!
```

**Result**: Every time user changes the capital input (or clicks preset buttons), `xlm_balance` updates **immediately**.

### Change 2: Improved "Initial Asset" Display

**File**: `app/dashboard.py`, Lines 215-254

**Before**:
```python
st.subheader("💰 Initial Asset")
st.info("Your wallet initial asset is **XLM**...")

# Static display, only updates after button click
if st.session_state.xlm_balance > 0:
    st.metric("Current XLM Balance", f"{st.session_state.xlm_balance:.2f} XLM")
```

**After**:
```python
st.subheader("💰 Initial Asset")
st.info("Your wallet initial asset is **XLM**...")

# ✅ Dynamic display, updates in real-time
if st.session_state.xlm_balance > 0:
    capital_usd = st.session_state.xlm_balance * 0.31
    st.metric(
        "Configured Capital",  # ✅ Better label
        f"{st.session_state.xlm_balance:.2f} XLM",
        delta=f"≈ ${capital_usd:,.2f} USD"  # ✅ Show USD equivalent
    )
    st.caption("💡 This will update as you select your capital below")

# Optional: Query real testnet balance (moved to expander)
with st.expander("🔍 Query Real Testnet Balance (Optional)"):
    if st.button("Query Testnet Balance"):
        # ... query real balance from chain ...
```

**Improvements**:
1. ✅ Shows both XLM and USD values
2. ✅ Updates in real-time as user changes capital
3. ✅ Clear caption explaining it's dynamic
4. ✅ Testnet balance query moved to expander (less cluttered)

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before Fix:

```
Step 1: User opens dashboard
   → "Initial Asset" shows: 3,225,806 XLM ($1M)

Step 2: User clicks "$1K" button
   → Number input updates to 1000
   → "Initial Asset" STILL shows: 3,225,806 XLM ❌
   → User thinks: "Why is it still showing $1M?"

Step 3: User clicks "Confirm"
   → "Initial Asset" NOW updates to: 3,226 XLM ✅
   → But this feels delayed and confusing
```

### After Fix:

```
Step 1: User opens dashboard
   → "Initial Asset" shows: 3,225,806 XLM ($1M) (default)

Step 2: User clicks "$1K" button
   → Number input updates to 1000
   → "Initial Asset" IMMEDIATELY updates to: 3,226 XLM ✅
   → Shows delta: "≈ $1,000 USD" ✅
   → Caption: "💡 This will update as you select your capital below" ✅
   → User thinks: "Great! It's responding to my input!"

Step 3: User scrolls down
   → "Configuration Summary" also shows: 3,226 XLM ✅
   → Everything is consistent

Step 4: User clicks "Confirm"
   → Everything is already correct ✅
   → Smooth experience!
```

## 📊 Real-time Update Flow

### New Flow:

```
User Action          → capital_usd changes
                     ↓
number_input         → st.session_state.initial_capital_usd = capital_usd
                     ↓
Immediate Conversion → xlm_amount = capital_usd / 0.31
                     ↓
Update Display       → st.session_state.xlm_balance = xlm_amount
                     ↓
UI Re-renders        → "Initial Asset" shows new value
                     → "Configuration Summary" shows new value
                     → "Conversion Preview" shows new value
```

**Result**: All displays update **simultaneously** when user changes capital!
