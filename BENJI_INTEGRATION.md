## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. Issuer Address - TODO
The current issuer address is a placeholder: `"FRANKLIN_TEMPLETON_ISSUER_TBD"`

**To Get Real Issuer Address**:
1. Visit: https://digitalassets.franklintempleton.com/benji/
2. Check Stellar blockchain explorer for BENJI token
3. Or contact Franklin Templeton for official issuer address
4. Update `config.yaml` with actual address

### 2. KYC/AML Requirements
BENJI is a **regulated security token**. Real trading requires:
- ‚úÖ KYC (Know Your Customer) verification
- ‚úÖ AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance
- ‚úÖ Accredited investor status (may be required)
- ‚úÖ Direct relationship with Franklin Templeton

**For Demo/Competition**: It's acceptable to use BENJI as a concept demonstration.

### 3. Testnet vs Mainnet
- **Mainnet**: BENJI exists on Stellar mainnet with real value
- **Testnet**: May not have BENJI token for testing
- **Demo Mode**: Your system uses simulated balances, so this doesn't affect functionality
