## ü§ñ Multi-Agent AI System

### Architecture

The platform uses three specialized AI agents powered by GPT-4, each with distinct roles and personalities:

#### 1. Trading Agent (Personality: "James Simons")
**Role**: Quantitative analysis and signal generation

**Capabilities**:
- 10 advanced trading strategies via function calling:
  - `buy_and_hold`: Long-term value investing
  - `momentum_breakout`: Capture trending moves
  - `mean_reversion`: Buy dips, sell rallies
  - `trend_following`: Ride established trends
  - `macd_strategy`: Technical momentum indicator
  - `zscore_mean_reversion`: Statistical arbitrage
  - `lgbm_strategy`: Gradient boosting ML model
  - `lstm_strategy`: Deep learning time-series prediction
  - `transformer_strategy`: Attention-based forecasting
  - `sac_strategy`: Soft Actor-Critic reinforcement learning

**News Sentiment Integration**:
- Fetches real-time news for each asset
- Performs sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
- Adjusts confidence scores based on sentiment

**Output**: Portfolio of 3-5 assets with action (BUY/SELL/HOLD), strategy used, confidence (0-1), and expected return (basis points)

#### 2. Risk Agent (Personality: "Risk Manager")
**Role**: Portfolio risk assessment and validation

**Risk Metrics Calculated**:
- **VaR (Value-at-Risk)**: 95% and 99% confidence levels
- **CVaR (Conditional VaR)**: Expected loss beyond VaR threshold
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
- **Sortino Ratio**: Downside risk-adjusted returns
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Portfolio Volatility**: Annualized standard deviation

**Validation Logic**:
- Checks if portfolio VaR exceeds tier limits
- Ensures asset diversification (minimum 2-3 assets)
- Validates that at least one asset has BUY intent (not all HOLD)
- Calculates risk score (0-10) for the portfolio

**Output**: APPROVED or REJECTED with detailed risk reasoning

#### 3. Payment Agent (Personality: "Execution Specialist")
**Role**: Trade execution on Stellar DEX

**Execution Process**:
1. Receives approved portfolio from Risk Agent
2. For each BUY signal:
   - Calculates XLM amount needed (using fixed XLM price = $0.31)
   - Simulates asset purchase
   - Updates internal balances
   - Records cost basis for P&L tracking
3. For SELL signals:
   - Converts asset back to XLM
   - Converts XLM to USDC (profit taking)
4. Auto-converts idle XLM to USDC (keeps 5% buffer for gas)

**Output**: Execution summary with successful/failed trades and final portfolio composition

### Core Functions & Features

#### 1. **Multi-Agent Governance**

**Function**: `initialize(admin, trading_agent, risk_agent, payment_agent, max_single_trade)`

**Purpose**: Set up the vault with three distinct agent addresses, implementing role-based access control.

**How It Works**:
- Each agent has a unique Stellar address
- Only Trading Agent can submit signals
- Only Risk Agent can approve/reject trades
- Only Payment Agent can execute approved trades
- Only Admin can halt the system in emergencies

**Product Impact**: Ensures no single point of failure; requires consensus between agents for trade execution.

---

#### 2. **Trade History & Audit Trail**

**Function**: `record_trade(signal_id, asset, action, amount, price, strategy, profit_loss, signer_secret)`

**Purpose**: Create an immutable, on-chain record of every trade executed by the AI system.

**Data Stored**:
```rust
pub struct TradeRecord {
    pub trade_id: u64,           // Unique trade identifier
    pub signal_id: u64,          // Links to trading signal
    pub asset: String,            // "BTC", "ETH", etc.
    pub action: String,           // "BUY" or "SELL"
    pub amount: i128,             // Amount traded (in stroops)
    pub price: i128,              // Execution price (scaled by 1e7)
    pub strategy: String,         // "momentum", "mean_reversion", etc.
    pub executed_at: u64,         // Unix timestamp
    pub profit_loss: i128,        // Realized P&L
}
```

**Query Functions**:
- `get_trade(trade_id)`: Retrieve specific trade details
- `get_total_trades()`: Get total number of trades executed

**Product Impact**: 
- Provides transparent audit trail for regulators/users
- Enables performance attribution (which strategy made/lost money)
- Immutable proof of AI decision-making process

---

#### 3. **AI Strategy Performance Tracking**

**Function**: `update_strategy_performance(strategy_name, is_winning_trade, profit, return_bps, signer_secret)`

**Purpose**: Track the real-world performance of each AI strategy on-chain.

**Metrics Tracked**:
```rust
pub struct StrategyPerformance {
    pub strategy_name: String,        // "momentum_breakout", "lstm_strategy"
    pub total_trades: u32,             // Total trades using this strategy
    pub winning_trades: u32,           // Number of profitable trades
    pub total_profit: i128,            // Cumulative profit in stroops
    pub avg_return: i32,               // Average return (basis points)
    pub sharpe_ratio: i32,             // Risk-adjusted performance
    pub last_updated: u64,             // Last update timestamp
}
```

**Query Function**:
- `get_strategy_performance(strategy_name)`: Retrieve performance metrics for any strategy

**Product Impact**: 
- AI system can learn which strategies work best
- Users can see which AI models are performing well
- Enables strategy rebalancing (allocate more to winning strategies)
- Transparency: proves the AI isn't just making random trades

**Example Use Case**:
After 100 trades, the data shows:
- `lstm_strategy`: 65% win rate, +15% return ‚Üí Increase allocation
- `mean_reversion`: 45% win rate, -5% return ‚Üí Decrease allocation

---

#### 4. **Portfolio Snapshots & ROI Tracking**

**Function**: `create_snapshot(timestamp, total_value, num_assets, total_trades, cumulative_return, signer_secret)`

**Purpose**: Create time-series snapshots of portfolio state for historical analysis.

**Data Stored**:
```rust
pub struct PortfolioSnapshot {
    pub snapshot_id: u64,          // Unique snapshot ID
    pub timestamp: u64,             // When snapshot was taken
    pub total_value: i128,          // Total portfolio value (stroops)
    pub num_assets: u32,            // Number of assets held
    pub total_trades: u64,          // Cumulative trades executed
    pub cumulative_return: i32,     // Total return since inception (bps)
}
```

**Query Function**:
- `get_latest_snapshot()`: Get most recent portfolio state

**Product Impact**: 
- Track portfolio growth over time
- Calculate historical ROI for users
- Prove the AI system's long-term performance
- Generate charts for demo/marketing (e.g., "AI-managed portfolio: +37% in 6 months")

---

#### 5. **Risk-Based Trading Limits**

**Function**: `validate_risk_metrics(var_95, sharpe_ratio, max_drawdown) ‚Üí bool`

**Purpose**: Enforce risk limits on-chain before trade execution.

**Validation Rules**:
- VaR (95%) must be ‚â§ 5% (500 basis points)
- Sharpe Ratio must be ‚â• 1.0 (100 scaled)
- Max Drawdown must be ‚â§ 20% (2000 basis points)

**Product Impact**: 
- **Trustless Risk Management**: Even if the Python Risk Agent is compromised, the smart contract provides a second layer of defense
- **User Protection**: Prevents the AI from taking excessive risks
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Demonstrates institutional-grade risk controls

**Example Scenario**:
1. AI Trading Agent suggests aggressive portfolio (80% volatile altcoins)
2. Python Risk Agent approves (bug or malicious actor)
3. Smart Contract rejects: "VaR 12% exceeds limit of 5%"
4. Trade is NOT executed ‚Üí User funds protected

---

#### 6. **Dynamic Stop-Loss (V2.0 Feature)**

**Function**: `set_dynamic_stop_loss(asset, stop_loss_bps, is_enabled, signer_secret)`

**Purpose**: Allow AI to adjust stop-loss levels dynamically based on market volatility.

**Data Structure**:
```rust
pub struct DynamicStopLossConfig {
    pub asset: String,              // "BTC", "ETH", etc.
    pub stop_loss_bps: i32,         // Stop-loss threshold (basis points)
    pub is_enabled: bool,           // Whether stop-loss is active
    pub last_updated: u64,          // Last update time
}
```

**Query Function**:
- `get_dynamic_stop_loss_config(asset)`: Check current stop-loss settings

**Product Impact**: 
- AI can tighten stop-losses during high volatility (protect profits)
- AI can loosen stop-losses during consolidation (avoid false exits)
- On-chain enforcement prevents stop-loss manipulation

**Example**:
- Normal market: BTC stop-loss = -5%
- High volatility detected: AI updates to -3% (protect capital)
- Market crashes 10%: Smart contract auto-exits at -3% loss

---

#### 7. **Emergency Halt Mechanism**

**Function**: `emergency_halt(signer_secret)` and `resume_operations(signer_secret)`

**Purpose**: Allow admin to pause all trading in case of:
- Smart contract bug discovered
- Extreme market volatility (e.g., flash crash)
- Regulatory concerns
- Security incident

**Product Impact**: 
- Safety net for users
- Demonstrates responsible risk management
- Regulatory compliance (can be halted if ordered)

**How It Works**:
- Admin calls `emergency_halt()`
- All trading functions return error: "System halted"
- Query functions still work (read-only)
- Admin calls `resume_operations()` when safe
